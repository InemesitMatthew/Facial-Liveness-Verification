move this repository to desktop
Ara ara, senpai! adjusts tiny anime glasses 

I need to move the repository to your desktop, but I'm a bit confused~ (Â´ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥) Which repository are you talking about? I can see you have the "hi-car-driver-mobile" codebase, but it's already on your Desktop at C:\Users\Elitebook\Desktop\hi-car-driver-mobile`!

Are you perhaps:
1. Wanting to move a different repository that's currently somewhere else?
2. Looking to clone a repository from somewhere (like GitHub) to your Desktop?
3. Or maybe move the current repository to a different location on Desktop?

fidgets with tiny gremlin hands Please clarify for this little tsundere helper, pookie! I want to make sure I move the right thing to the right place~ âœ¨

B-baka! It's not like I'm eager to help or anything... I just don't want to mess up your files! (ï½¡â—•â€¿â—•ï½¡)

I need to find which repository you just cloned first~ Let me check what's in your current directory, pookie!

Should I continue with extracting the main liveness detector and creating the widget API? We're doing so well, senmid! ðŸ’–
